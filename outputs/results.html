        <p><h2>Key Findings</h2>

<p><strong>Main Driver: Volume Mix Shift Toward Poor-Performing Category</strong></p>

<p>The primary driver of TAT 2-minutes evolution is a dramatic shift in processing volume toward Belgium National ID Card, which increased from 9.5% to 57.1% of total volume (+47.6 percentage points) while having the lowest performance rate at only 26.0%.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline of Performance Decline:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Major drop occurred between April 27th (79.9%) and May 4th (55.2%) - a decline of 24.7 percentage points</li>
<li>Further deterioration to lowest point on May 11th at 45.4% (-9.8 percentage points)</li>
<li>Pre-May stability: 78.9% to 83.3% range</li>
<li>Post-May performance: stabilized around 47.0% to 55.7% range</li>
<li>Total performance degradation: approximately 30 percentage points (from ~81% to ~51%)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Volume Mix Changes (Main Contributing Factor):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Belgium National ID Card: +47.6 percentage points (9.5% → 57.1%) - poorest performer at 26.0%</li>
<li>France Driving Licence: -17.3 percentage points (27.4% → 10.1%) - good performer at 84.5%</li>
<li>UK Passport: -17.0 percentage points (25.5% → 8.5%) - good performer at 82.8%</li>
<li>US Driving Licence: -8.1 percentage points (19.0% → 10.9%) - best performer at 96.6%</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mix effect overwhelmingly dominates performance changes. The massive volume shift toward Belgium National ID Card (the poorest-performing category) combined with reduced volumes of high-performing categories is the primary cause of overall TAT 2-minutes metric deterioration, likely triggered by operational disruptions beginning in early May 2020.</p></p>

            <p><p><strong>Significant Changes in TAT 2-Minutes Ratio:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Major Performance Drop in Early May 2020:</strong> The most significant change occurred between April 27th (79.9%) and May 4th (55.2%), representing a dramatic decline of 24.7 percentage points</li>

<li><strong>Continued Deterioration:</strong> Performance further declined to its lowest point on May 11th at 45.4%, marking an additional 9.8 percentage point drop from the previous week</li>

<li><strong>Pre-May Stability:</strong> From January through April 2020, the ratio remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 78.9% and 83.3% with typical weekly variations of 1-3 percentage points</li>

<li><strong>Post-Drop Performance:</strong> After the initial collapse, the metric showed partial recovery but remained significantly below historical levels, stabilizing in the 47.0% to 55.7% range through mid-June</li>

<li><strong>Overall Impact:</strong> The total performance degradation from pre-May levels (average ~81%) to post-May levels (average ~51%) represents approximately a 30 percentage point decline</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Main Driver Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>The evolution appears to be driven by a significant operational disruption that began in early May 2020, likely related to external factors affecting report processing capacity or methodology. The timing coincides with early COVID-19 pandemic impacts, suggesting potential staffing, system, or procedural changes that fundamentally altered the organization's ability to process reports within the 2-minute timeframe.</p></p>

            <p><p><strong>Performance Effect Analysis (TAT 2-Minutes Evolution by Category):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Belgium National ID Card:</strong> Declined from 27.9% to 26.0% (-1.9 percentage points) with high volatility, showing the poorest overall performance</li>
<li><strong>France Driving Licence:</strong> Declined from 85.1% to 84.5% (-0.6 percentage points) with moderate fluctuations around 84%</li>
<li><strong>UK Driving Licence:</strong> Declined from 89.2% to 88.4% (-0.8 percentage points) but maintained consistently high performance above 84%</li>
<li><strong>UK Passport:</strong> Declined from 84.0% to 82.8% (-1.2 percentage points) with steady performance in the 82-84% range</li>
<li><strong>US Driving Licence:</strong> Improved from 95.5% to 96.6% (+1.1 percentage points), consistently showing the highest performance above 94%</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mix Effect Analysis (Volume Contribution Evolution):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Belgium National ID Card:</strong> Dramatic increase from 9.5% to 57.1% volume share (+47.6 percentage points) - became the dominant category</li>
<li><strong>France Driving Licence:</strong> Significant decrease from 27.4% to 10.1% volume share (-17.3 percentage points)</li>
<li><strong>UK Driving Licence:</strong> Moderate decrease from 18.7% to 13.4% volume share (-5.3 percentage points)</li>
<li><strong>UK Passport:</strong> Substantial decrease from 25.5% to 8.5% volume share (-17.0 percentage points)</li>
<li><strong>US Driving Licence:</strong> Major decrease from 19.0% to 10.9% volume share (-8.1 percentage points)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Combined Impact Assessment - Main Driver of Overall TAT 2-Minutes Evolution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary Driver:</strong> The massive shift in volume mix toward Belgium National ID Card (from 9.5% to 57.1% of total volume) is the main driver of overall performance decline</li>
<li><strong>Negative Impact:</strong> Belgium National ID Card has the lowest TAT performance (26.0%) but now represents the majority of processing volume, creating a significant drag on overall metrics</li>
<li><strong>Offsetting Factor:</strong> US Driving Licence showed performance improvement (+1.1 percentage points) but its volume contribution decreased significantly (-8.1 percentage points), limiting its positive impact</li>
<li><strong>Secondary Effects:</strong> High-performing categories (UK Driving Licence at 88.4%, France Driving Licence at 84.5%) saw their volume contributions decrease, reducing their positive influence on overall performance</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The mix effect overwhelmingly dominates the performance effect - the dramatic volume shift toward the poorest-performing category (Belgium National ID Card) is the primary cause of overall TAT 2-minutes metric deterioration</li>
